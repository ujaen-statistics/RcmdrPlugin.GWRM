\title{GWRM Plug-In for R Commander}
\description{
This package is an R Commander "plug-in" based on the 
\code{GWRM} package (see \code{\link{GWRM}}). It provides a GUI for fitting a generalized Waring regression model to a 
dataset, together with other common regression functions such as Akaike and 
Bayesian information criteria, stepwise model selection or add observation
statistics to data. Moreover, it allows for computing the partition of the
variance for the selected \code{GW} model and carrying out a graphical diagnosis 
by a simulated envelope of the residuals.
